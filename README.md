# jg-cl-sorted-vector

I wanted utilities for easily removing from the middle of a resizable vector and resizing it because of that, and inserting into the middle of one as well. I also wanted a similar facility to C++'s "sorted vector" which is a resizable vector that maintains it's sorted order in the face of insertions and removals and thus can offer very quick searching and sorting.
